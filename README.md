# Spam Classifier
This project is a python implementation of a Spam Classifier using Natural Language Processing. The goal of the classifier is to predict whether a given message is spam or not.

## Dataset
The SMS Spam Collection Dataset is used for training and testing the classifier. The dataset contains a set of SMS messages that have been labeled as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

## Data Preprocessing
The first step is to clean and preprocess the data. This involves removing any special characters and punctuation, converting all text to lowercase, and stemming the words (i.e., reducing them to their root form). Stop words (common words such as "the" and "and") are also removed.

## Feature Extraction
The next step is to convert the preprocessed text into a numerical form that can be used for training the classifier. The Bag of Words model is used for this purpose. In this model, a corpus of words is created, and each word is assigned a unique integer ID. Each document (i.e., SMS message) is then represented as a vector of word counts, where the element at each index represents the number of times that word appears in the document.

## Model Training
The Naive Bayes algorithm is used to train the spam classifier. This algorithm is based on Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of a given event (in this case, whether a message is spam or not) based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event (in this case, the words in the message).

## Evaluation
The trained classifier is evaluated using a test set of SMS messages. The accuracy of the classifier is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels in the test set.

## Conclusion
In this project, a Spam Classifier has been implemented using Natural Language Processing. The classifier is able to accurately predict whether a given message is spam or not. The code can be easily modified to work with other datasets and to experiment with different algorithms and feature extraction techniques.
